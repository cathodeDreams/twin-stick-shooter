-playtesting notes-

The menu needs to be refactored. I believe this should be done as part of a complete UI overhaul. Need to brainstorm.

H and B powerups seem to not do anything. Maybe like above the powerup system needs refactoring.

The graze system is very cool. The visual effect of grazing is amazing and done well. There needs to be a visual change going from graze level to level. Potentially a palette shift? 

The fire rate is good. There needs to be visual UI info about how long until a powerup burns out and what powerup is active.

Overall the game is fun, but still in very early stages. The gamefeel is good.
